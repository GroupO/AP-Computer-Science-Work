Test Project
---

You have been asked to write a program to grade the results of a true-false quiz and display the results in tabular form. The quiz consists of 10 questions.  The data file for this problem consists of 1 set of correct responses (answerkey) on line one and succeeding lines containing a four digit student identification number followed by that student's 10 responses.  (The number of students taking the quiz in currently unknown.)

**The data file is in the form :**

	TFFTFTTFTT
	0461 TTFTTFTFTT
	3218 TFFTTTTTFT
	.....................
	....................

Your program should read the key and store it in a one dimensional array.  It should then read and process each succeeding line, storing the student identification numbers in a one dimensional array and the grades in two separate one dimensional arrays- one for numeric grades and the for letter grades. 

Numeric grades are  converted to letter according to the following system :  A(10), B(9), C(8-7), D (6-5), F(4-0). 

**Program output should include the following :** 

1. Each Student's four digit identification number, their numeric grade and their letter grade. 

2. A printed count of how many students took the quiz.

3. The numeric quiz average for the entire class. 

4. A frequency count of the number of A's, B's, C's,D's and F's for the entire class.

**Expected structures include loops, parallel arrays, strings, methods and  parameter passing.**

**It is crucial that everyone succeed in creating a working copy of this project because it will be the starting point for a major revision in weeks 22 and 23 !!!**
