AP Computer Science Junk
---
This repository is simply all of the assignments and other junk that I will accumulate while taking AP Computer Science. My hopes with this code being on Github is that any of my classmates who need help or examples can come here to find it. 

All of the code (except textbook examples) I reserve the rights to. I can't imagine anyone would actually need to use it for anything, but if you do, just ask.
