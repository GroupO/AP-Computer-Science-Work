AP Computer Science Junk
---
This repository is simply all of the assignments and other junk that I will accumulate while taking AP Computer Science. My hopes with this code being on Github is that any of my classmates who need help or examples can come here to find it. 

I'm starting also to mirror all of the projects that we do in Objective-C, to help myself learn development for iOS. Those projects have the same name as the Java ones, but with "XCode" as a suffix on the name. For example, *Week8 Project 3-5* is a Java project, and *Week8 Project 3-5 XCode* is written in Objective-C. Feel free to check it out.

All of the code (except textbook examples) I reserve the rights to. I can't imagine anyone would actually need to use it for anything, but if you do, just ask.
